TIMER A Blink 
Max Tensfeldt
Intro to Embedded - Section 2

The task of Timer A Blink was to blink an LED at a constant speed using the built in timers. All the boards use SMCLK and Continuous timer.

* MSP430G2553
LED = P1.0
P1.0 blinks at a constant rate

* MSP430F5529
LED = P1.0
P1.0 blinks at a constant rate

* MSP430FR2311
LED = P1.0
P1.0 blinks at a constant rate
The biggest difference was this board’s use of the timer which had to be called differently

* MSP430FR5994
LED = P1.0
P1.0 blinks at a constant rate

* MSP430FR6989
LED = P1.0
P1.0 blinks at a constant rate
